# WPPNets: Unsupervised CNN Training with Wasserstein Patch Priors for Image Superresolution

This code belongs to the paper [1] available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08157.
Please cite the paper, if you use this code.

The paper [1] is 
The repository contains an implementation of WPPNets as introduced in [1]. It contains scripts for reproducing the numerical example Texture superresolution in Section 5.2.

Moreover, the file `wgenpatex.py` is adapted from [2] available at https://github.com/johertrich/Wasserstein_Patch_Prior and is adapted from [3]. Furthermore, the folder `model` is adapted from [5] available at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/ACNet.

The folders `test_img` and `training_img` contain parts of the textures from [4].

## CONTENTS

1. REQUIREMENTS  
2. USAGE AND EXAMPLES
3. REFERENCES

## 1. REQUIREMENTS

The code requires several Python packages. We tested the code with Python 3.9.7 and the following package versions:

- pytorch 1.10.0
- matplotlib 3.4.3
- numpy 1.21.2
- pykeops 1.5

Usually the code is also compatible with some other versions of the corresponding Python packages.

## 2. USAGE AND EXAMPLES

You can start the training of the WPPNet by calling the scripts. If you want to load the existing network, please set `retrain` to `False`. Checkpoints are saved automatically during training such that the progress of the reconstructions is observable. Feel free to vary the parameters and see what happens. 

### TEXTURE GRASS

The script `run_grass.py` is the implementation of the superresolution example in [1, Section 5.2] for the Kylberg Texture [4] `grass`  which is available at https://kylberg.org/kylberg-texture-dataset-v-1-0. The high-resolution ground  truth and the reference image are different 600×600 sections cropped from the original texture images. Similarly, the low-resolution training data is generated by cropping 100×100 sections from the texture images, artificially downsampling it by a predefined forward operator f and adding Gaussian noise. For more details on the downsampling process, see [1, Section 5.2]. 

### TEXTURE FLOOR

The script `run_floor.py` is the implementation of the superresolution example in [1, Section 5.2] for the Kylberg Texture [4] `Floor`  which is available at https://kylberg.org/kylberg-texture-dataset-v-1-0. The high-resolution ground  truth and the reference image are different 600×600 sections cropped from the original texture images. Similarly, the low-resolution training data is generated by cropping 100×100 sections from the texture images, artificially downsampling it by a predefined forward operator f and adding Gaussian noise. For more details on the downsampling process, see [1, Section 5.2].
